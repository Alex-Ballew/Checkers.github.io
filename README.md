# Checkers game using javascript, css, html
The following is a fully functional checkers game I made as a fun practice problem to learn html, css, javascript. It incoporates error handling full invalid moves with messages on the game terminal, the game is currently set up to only work on one device, so both players must be on the same device.

## Rules: ##
<pre>
<b>Movement:</b>
  
  1. You can only move on black squares, so the pieces move diagonally. 
  
  2. Non-kings can only move forward toward their opponent.
  
<b>Capturing pieces:</b>
  
  1. In a capturing move, a piece leaps off the opponent’s piece in a diagonal line, landing on a dark
  square on the other side. 
  
  2. While you can only capture one piece per jump, you can make multiple jumps in a single turn if 
  the positioning of the pieces allows!
  
  3. After you capture a piece, you remove it from the board and the opponent collects it.
  
  4. If you can jump your opponent’s pieces, <b>you must</b>. However, if there is more than one 
  capture possible from a single square, you may jump whichever piece is preferable.
  
<b>Kings:</b>
  
  1. Once you reach the first row of their opponent’s side of the board, your checker will be kinged!
  
  2. Kings can only move diagonally, as well. However, they can move forward or backward as opposed 
  to single pieces.
  
<b>How to win:</b>
  
  1.You capture the entirety of a player’s pieces, or you block a player’s pieces from moving.
